| DATACOLLECTION_QUESTIONNAIRE_1    | Indicate the study type that resulted in your data (i.e., how the data was obtained).<br><br>Randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a study in which participants are randomly assigned to two or more groups. Participants are typically allocated to either the intervention/experimental group or a control condition. | DATACOLLECTION_QUESTIONNAIRE_2                   | DATACOLLECTION_QUESTIONNAIRE_3                      |

This could be the case when they don't remember, focus on positive result, or give an answer they believe the researcher is looking for. | DATACOLLECTION_RECALL_SOCIALDESIRABILITY_BIAS    | DATACOLLECTION_QUESTIONNAIRE_5                      |
