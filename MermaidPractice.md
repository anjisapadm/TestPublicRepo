This bias can arise because people tend to focus on documenting circumstances that are unusual or especially memorable (recall bias) or on reporting events or giving answers that they think are desirable (social desirability bias).</span><br>"] -- Mitigation --> n6["<p><em style='color: rgb(45, 155, 240);'>Prior to Data collection:</em></p><p>Recall bias can be mitigated by blinding the data collection and by using additional/different assessments than only participant interviews (e.g. supplementing self-report with other-report). Certain factors increase the risk of recall bias, e.g. asking about information from a long time ago, age and education of participants. A prospective design generally decreases the risk of recall bias.</p><p></p><p>Social desirability bias can be reduced by making sure that the participants do not know the purpose of the study and by anonymizing data collection. Other techniques that have been proposed include adapting study protocols to reduce socially desirable responses, e.g. by leaving the room during questionnaire fill-out or by using specialized questioning techniques. In addition, it may be helpful to assess participants for likelihood to respond socially desirably.</p>"]
